## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table and .planning/DECISIONS.md.

- Initial stack locked: Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.x backend, PostgreSQL/Flyway, Expo React Native TypeScript mobile.
- Backend is source of truth for family isolation, wallet balance, mission rules, reward redemption, and coin ledger.
- MVP avoids overengineering and prioritizes a demonstrable end-to-end TCC flow.
- Phase 1 uses email/password with JWT bearer tokens and derives tenant context from JWT claims.
- Children are `ChildProfile` records only in Phase 1, not authenticatable users.
- Tenant isolation is explicit through `CurrentUser.familyUnitId` and family-scoped repository methods.
